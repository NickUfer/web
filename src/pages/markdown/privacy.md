This privacy policy outlines how we handle information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual ("Personal Information") and describes the Personal Information collected by Ory Corp, through its websites, products, and applications that together constitute the Ory Corp service (“the Service”), and how and for what purposes it is collected and used.

We believe that Personal Information that is submitted by or collected from individuals is private. Ory Corp does not rent, sell, or otherwise share this Personal Information.

## Information Collected

When using the Service you may enter, among other things, your name and / or email address which is used to provide, for example, the Ory newsletter and other notifications about updates to the Service. The information collected by Ory Corp is sent to servers located in countries around the world, including among others, countries in the European Economic Area (EAA) and the United States. When transferring and receiving information, Ory Corp follows generally accepted and recognized standards and best practices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 
The following are examples of the types of information we collect through the Service:
 
*Information you give to us.* We collect and store any personal information you submit to the Service by entering it or in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, and phone number. Other examples of information that you might submit on the Service are about your location (such as ZIP code and/or country). We collect this information to provide you with information about Ory Corp’s products, keep you informed and up to date about the service, and to send you other notifications that are relevant to and useful to your use of the Service.

We do not publicly display or provide access to personally identifying information. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share the information.

*Information collected using third party metrics and analytics services.* We use third party metrics and analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect information and to learn more about the visitors to our Service. We also do this to be able to gauge how effectively we are marketing the service. Information collected include third party tags and cookies, Ory cookies, browser metadata, and IP addresses among other things. We use the information collected to maintain a good Service experience and to help us understand who is visiting the Service from where and for what reasons. This information may be compiled and analyzed by Ory Corp.


## Messages and Notifications

At times, we will notify you by email about updates, changes, and other service related information. We will never ask you for personal information in those notifications and communication, or in any other communication from Ory Corp.

## Links to Third Parties

The Service may contain links to third party websites or services with which we may or may not have affiliation to Ory Corp. We do not share your personal information with those third parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices.

## Policy for Children

The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information.

## Security

Ory Corp takes appropriate administrative, technical, physical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the Personal Information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
