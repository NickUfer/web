## Introduction

You might ask yourself: “Why do I need a guide to mobile and native app
authorization and OAuth2? I’ll simply use the OAuth 2.0 Implicit flow and I’m
good to go, or the OAuth2 Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow! Please
don’t - and I’ll explain why. If you need a refresh on OAuth2, check out the
excellent
[guide from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2).

First, you will learn why the old way of solving mobile app authorization is
neither good practice nor secure. Second, you will be introduced to the OAuth2
Authorize Code flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for public clients.
Third, you will be supplied with links to open source software capable of
solving the introduced flows and features.

## What To Avoid From Now On

As author & maintainer of various open source projects in the area of OAuth2,
OpenID Connect, Access Control and API Security, I have seen a lot of questions,
environments, and use cases. I will quickly walk through the most common ones
and explain why you should avoid those.

### The OAuth2 Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

Typically, mobile apps are first-party (written by the company’s developers)
clients. Product managers and designers want to keep the user experience clean.
It is not uncommon that developers are asked to present the user with an in-app
login screen (“Please enter your username and password”) which exchanges those
credentials for a token which allows the app to access some APIs. In the context
of OAuth2, this is usually achieved using the OAuth2 Resource Owner Password
Credentials Flow.

Unfortunately, this practice makes it possible for attackers to create a
counterfeit app which logs user credentials. The user is not able to distinguish
the login screen in the counterfeit from legitimate apps, because there is no
domain name, no TLS certificate, and more broadly no trusted environment
(Browser). If the attackers can push a counterfeit app to the app store, users -
used to enter their credentials in the app - will not become suspicious.

Let’s take a look at an example. The two screenshots below are from two
different apps. The one on the left is the original app, the one on the right
the counterfeit one. Can you spot the difference? Me neither, it’s a perfect
replicate. There are, of course, some limitations to this attack. For one, the
counterfeit app has to make it on the user’s phone. Unfortunately, counterfeit
apps are so common, there’s even an article on
[Lifehacker (“How to Spot Fake Apps in Apple's App Store and Google Play”)](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-spot-fake-apps-in-apples-app-store-and-google-pl-1821428717)
on this topic.


<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="50%">
            <img alt="Legitimate Application without Browser Authorization" src="../../images/articles/mobile-oauth2/login-app.png"/>
        </td>
        <td width="50%">
            <img alt="Legitimate Application without Browser Authorization" src="../../images/articles/mobile-oauth2/login-app.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td colspan="2">
        <p>
            Without a browser address bar, there is no way to distinguish between a legitimate and an illegimitate app.
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

If a browser is involved, the user will see the URL and be able to validate the
TLS certificate if in doubt. Let’s take a look at the two login screens again,
but this time in a browser. You should be able to spot which one is the phishing
site and which one isn’t.

<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="50%">
            <img alt="Legitimate Application with Browser Authorization" src="../../images/articles/mobile-oauth2/login-app-legitimate.png"/>
        </td>
        <td width="50%">
            <img alt="Illegitimate Application with Browser Authorization" src="../../images/articles/mobile-oauth2/login-app-counterfeit.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td colspan="2">
            <p>
                Without the browser address bar, you can easily spot the illegitimate app (right).
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

It becomes apparent that you should train the user’s eye and opt for
authentication & authorization through a trusted environment (the browser).
While, regrettably, some users will remain susceptible to phishing attacks, you
can certainly reduce the overall success rate of phishing attacks against your
services.

### The OAuth2 Implicit Flow

The OAuth2 implicit Flow **was** the go-to flow for mobile apps, single page
apps, and native apps. The IETF summarizes this flow as follows:

> The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow optimized for
> clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as
> JavaScript. In the implicit flow, instead of issuing the client an
> authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly (as the
> result of the resource owner authorization). The grant type is implicit, as no
> intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are issued (and later
> used to obtain an access token). -
> [Source](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749%23section-1.3.1)

The most prominent downside to this flow is that no refresh tokens may be
issued. Every time an access token expires, the user must redo the whole
authorize dance (open browser -> authenticate -> authorize) - not a great user
experience.

Another issue is that Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) can not protect the
OAuth2 Implicit Flow. The IETF explicitly states that this flow is not
recommended for use with native & mobile applications:

> The OAuth2 implicit grant authorization flow generally works with the practice
> of performing the authorization request in the browser and receiving the
> authorization response via URI-based inter-app communication. However, as the
> implicit flow cannot be protected by PKCE, the use of the Implicit Flow with
> native apps is NOT RECOMMENDED.

> Access tokens granted via the implicit flow also cannot be refreshed without
> user interaction, making the authorization code grant flow -- which can issue
> refresh tokens -- the more practical option for native app authorizations that
> require refreshing of access tokens.

In the context of browser apps (“single page apps”), the OAuth2 Implicit Flow
was designed when most browsers did not allow developers to modify the history
via, for example, \`pushState\`. Back then, using hashtags was the only way to
transmit data via URLs to JavaScript applications running in the browser. Today,
as browser APIs improved, it’s possible to use the OAuth2 Authorize Code Flow
for browser apps instead, and benefit from, e.g., refresh tokens.

### Embedded User Agents

[The IETF encourages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252%23section-4)
developers to avoid embedded user agents, sometimes referred to as web-views,
and use external user-agents, typically the browser. Here is why:

> Embedded user-agents are unsafe for use by third parties to the authorization
> server by definition, as the app that hosts the embedded user-agent can access
> the user's full authentication credential, not just the OAuth authorization
> grant that was intended for the app.

> In typical web-view-based implementations of embedded user-agents, the host
> application can record every keystroke entered in the login form to capture
> usernames and passwords, automatically submit forms to bypass user consent,
> and copy session cookies and use them to perform authenticated actions as the
> user. - [Source](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252%23section-8.12)

## What To Do Instead

Now you know what to avoid. Let’s talk about what to do instead!

### The OAuth2 Authorize Code Flow With Public Clients

The OAuth2 Authorize Code Flow provides the means for clients, which can not
keep passwords secret, to request authorization on a user’s behalf. This is
possible with a public client. The only differences between confidential
(regular) and public clients are that no secret was issued to that client, and
that the client is explicitly intended for use with mobile, browser, and native
apps.

Public clients are capable of performing all flows except the **Resource Owner
Password Credentials** flow and the **Client Credentials** flow. They are also
allowed to request OpenID Connect ID Tokens, and refresh expired access or ID
tokens. Other than the missing client secret, the flow is executed in the same
way as the regular OAuth2 Authorize Code flow. It is recommended to send the
client ID in the POST body or the URL query, as HTTP Basic Authorization does
not work well (if at all) with an empty password field

### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

The OAuth2 Implicit and Authorize Code Flows are vulnerable in the context of
mobile and native apps, specifically when custom redirect URI schemes are used
that are not protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).

If an attacker manages to register a malicious application on the client device
and registers a custom URI scheme that is also used by the legitimate
application, it is possible for the attacker to intercept the authorize code and
obtain its access token.

![Stylized PKCE Flow](../../images/articles/mobile-oauth2/pkce.png)

To mitigate this attack, the legitimate app generates a so-called code challenge
and code verifier. The code verifier is derived from the code challenge. There
are multiple ways of generating the code challenge, the most secure one is to
use SHA-256: `code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))`

The code challenge is submitted to the OAuth2 Authorization Server during the
Authorization Request, when the browser hits the \`/oauth2/auth\` endpoint. The
code verifier, only known to the legitimate application, is transmitted when the
authorization code is exchanged for access and refresh tokens. The OAuth2
Authorization Server does not issue access and refresh tokens when an invalid
code verifier is submitted. The malicious app is therefore not able to use the
authorization code and thus the vulnerability is mitigated.

## Open Source Technology

OAuth2, OpenID Connect, PKCE, JWTs, … - these standards as useful as they are
complicated. It is well known that developers should never roll their own
crypto, unless of course they are a cryptographer. The same should apply to
these standards. I strongly encourage everyone in the community to rely on
adopted, tested, and reliable open source technology. These topics have been
covered in various programming languages and are easy to integrate.

Ok, so let’s take a look at what technology you can use to provide and consume
OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). Some of the
technology presented is written and maintained by ORY. Everything is licensed
